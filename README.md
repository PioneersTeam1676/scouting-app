the team 1676 scouting app - must have a working scouting backend for this to function properly (see scout-form-builder repository). In theory this app should never have to be updated but if new features are wanted(different input types etc.) then someone will have to code them!

some quirks to this app:
- you need to do **npm install --force** not npm install
- if you can update everything to a newer version that would be great without breaking everything but good luck with that
- i dont think theres anything else weird with the app, it was mainly just everything is really old and you have to force install

order of people to ask if smth breaks:
1. yourslef- what did you just do, try to undo it.
2. google- this prly happens ot a bunch of ppl just google it
3. chatgpt- if google dosen't know then a chatbot might
4. team members- someone might know what ur problem is, ask them
5. larry- sorry larry
6. me(dylan)- if all else fails you can email me or smth(dylanbarrett360@gmail.com) but only if everything else reallly fails and dont tell anyone else that i am available to fix stuff its only for this app. defintly not for aceit dont ask me to fix aceit.
